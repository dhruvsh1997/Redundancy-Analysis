# Redundancy-Analysis
Redundancy algorithm for embedded memories with block-based architecture. Abstract: Built-in self-repair (BISR) is widely used to repair embedded memories within system on a chip (SoC) designs to improve their yield. ... In most BISR designs, redundancies are used on the row/column level.
